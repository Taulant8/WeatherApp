# WeatherApp
 This is a simple weather app made with Javascript.
 
 The main purpose of this app was the usage of **Async & Await** functions with promises and manipulation with DOM.Therefore, there are 2 scripts on this file : 
 - app.js (used for DOM manipulation)
 - forecast.js (used to get the weather API) 
  
 
 There are 2 API endpoints requests I used to fetch the data generated from the website AccuWeather : 
 
 - Location (City)
 - Weather conditions

The code of this part is as shown below.

Using DOM manipulation, we can set the image of the weather to be day or night,what temperature it is, weather description based on the properies IsDayTime,WeatherText and Temperature inside the object **weather** returned by the API :
